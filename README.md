# Hang man

This was a mini project, where you had to create the game hangman. 

you get 6 tries (or how many you set) to get guess the given word correctly. 

have fun with it :) 

### How to use it

Navigate to the folder where Hangman.py is saved in the command prompt and use the command 
```python Hangman.py``` 

This will start the game. If you guess the word the game will end, and will have to rerun

If your strike out, it will ask if you want to try again with another word.
